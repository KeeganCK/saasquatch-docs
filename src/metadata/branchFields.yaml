  The SaaSquatch integration with Branch Metrics includes these fields as `data` in referral branch deep links.
type: object
properties:
  
  ##
  ## User
  ##
  sq_id:
    type: string
    description: "The Referrer's user ID. This allows you to look up the user in your own system."
  sq_accountId:
    type: string
    description: "The Referrer's account ID. This allows you to look up group or company info. See [Shared vs. Solo accounts](shared-vs-solo-accounts/)"
  sq_firstName:
    type: string
    description: "The Referrer's first name."
  sq_lastName:
    type: string
    description: "The Referrer's last name."
  sq_imageUrl:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Referrer's profile image URL. Note that unlike the user's `imageUrl` that is used other places in SaaSquatch, like via API, in theme context and in Squatch.js, if this field is set to `null` it won't actually be `null`.
      Instead, when set to `null` it is instead replaced by a gravatar link that's automatically generated based upon a hash for the Referrer user's email address
      for when we do not have an image URL for that user. If you want to detect for null images instead you should look for if it's gravatar, or not use this field and look up the value in your
      user database, or something else.
  
  ##
  ## Referral Code
  ##
  sq_referralCode:
    type: string
    description: "The Referrer's referral code. This is necessary to [attribute the referral](/success/core-topics/#attribution)."

  ##
  ## Reward 
  ##
  sq_amount:
    type: string
    description: |
      The amount of the Referred User's reward. This is sort of like the reward fields returned from the [lookup referral code API call](/api/methods/#get_code)
      for explaining a reward but it's different and uses a custom mapping of fields described in the table below to map from this abstract field (that's not available
      in the API) to other stored or calculated fields for rewards that can be looked up directly via the API, or the fields used in `programDetails` of theme context
      or the fields in squatch.js, or other places where rewards are used. Use this convenient mapping table:
      
        - For rewards of type `TIME_CREDIT` and `CREDIT` this field is equal to the reward field called `credit`
        - For rewards of type `PCT_DISCOUNT` this field is equal to the reward field called `discountPercent`
        - For rewards of type `FEATURE` this field is equal to the reward field called `quantity`
        - For rewards of type `GIFTCODE` this field is empty
  sq_unit:
    type: string
    description: "The unit of the Referred User's reward. For example, in a 10% off referral program this would be `PERCENT`"
  sq_type:
    type: string
    description: "The type of the Referred User's reward. One of: `PCT_DISCOUNT`, `TIME_CREDIT`, `FEATURE`, `CREDIT`, `GIFTCODE`"
