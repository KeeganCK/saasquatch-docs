### Tips To Fix This

Review your API Call against our official list of [SaaSquatch API Calls](/api/methods) to ensure that the call you are using is designed to work with Growth Automation Programs.

If you continue to receive this error, please contact our [Success Team](mailto:success@referralsaasquatch.com) and include details of the call being made (e.g. `tenant_alias`, Method and use case).

### Why is This Happening?

If you received this error message, you are attempting to use a legacy API call that was not designed for the program you are using. While most API calls are designed to be used with both Growth Automation and Classic Programs, some will only work with Classic Programs.
